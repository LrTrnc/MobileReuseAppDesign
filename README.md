# Mobile Reuse App Design Using Figma
Recycling is a widely known way to combat climate change and its impacts. Items are turned
into raw materials which can be used again, usually for a completely new product. However,
recycling technologies and processes, in themselves, consume energy and can produce
waste by-products. A more sustainable process is reuse. Using an object as it is without
treatment helps to tackle climate change by reducing pollution and waste. Reuse is also a
great way to give an item a new life, to save money and to alleviate poverty.
Your group has been tasked with designing a mobile reuse app that would allow students to
buy & sell second hand items.

Users should be able to complete the following activities, each of which will be reflected as a
component of functionality within the application:

1) Publish an item and its collection location
2) Search & filter across a range of available items before requesting them and agreeing
on arrangements for their collection;
3) Create and share reviews of their experience after buying a second hand item.
   
In addition, our group is required to design one additional component of functionality for
users that emerges from our user requirements gathering work.


What to include in Group Project Report?

1) First, as a group we need to create an interview (prepare the questions together as a
group) to gather user requirements from our potential users. Our target user group is
University students, so we need to interview students only. In our interview, we need to
include demographic questions, and relevant questions to find out what users would like to
see in a new second hand buy & sell app (if they have used such an app before, we can
directly ask their experiences, if not, we can show them an existing recycling app, and then
ask what they liked/disliked about the app). Groups should conduct a minimum of 2
interviews per group member. (if you are a group of 5 people, you should conduct at least
10 interviews). In your Group Project Report you need to provide all details of these
interviews. In our Group Presentation we need to summarise what we have found during
the interviews.

2) Using the information we collected through interviews, we need to create 1 persona
that can be used in the user-centred design process. For our persona, describe 1 goal that
could be satisfied by our interactive system prototype.

3) Create 1 Problem (as-is) scenario that describes current user practice in relation to the
Design Problem described in this document. The scenario should involve the persona we
created.

4) Create 1 Activity (to-be) scenario that describes current user practice in relation to the
Design Problem described in this document. The scenario should involve the persona we
created.

5) After creating the scenarios, we will need to design your digital prototype using
appropriate digital prototyping tool (We used Figma). Our digital prototype should
include all necessary screens (including Register/Login page). In the Group Project Report we
should provide a general introduction to the digital prototype of the mobile app and
explain how it addresses the goal of the user described in our persona. The report will
describe four substantial, complex components of the functionality in the prototype (3 of
them outlined above, and 1 will be chosen by the group). The report should provide
screenshots to illustrate these components of functionality. The report should describe the
design choices behind each component of functionality in terms of how it satisfies the user
requirements derived from the persona, and activities presented in the scenarios.

6) After we have done our digital prototype, we should undertake a Collaborative
Heuristic Evaluation (CHE) on our digital prototype. Our tasks when conducting CHE will be
the 4 functionalities (3 of them outlined above, and 1 will be chosen by the group). In our
report, we need to describe the process of CHE (how did we conduct CHE as a group, the
roles of group members, etc.), the usability problems (we are free to use Petrie & Power
Heuristics and/or Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics when finding usability problems) found while trying to
complete the tasks. We also need to provide the mean severity ratings we have found for
each usability problem.

7) After conducting CHE, we need to re-design our prototype in order to fix the usability
issues found, and then we should explain what changes you have done to your final version
of the prototype.

8) Screenshots of all the screens of your digital prototype are provided in an Appendix section at
the end of the report.
